## Parcelable Interface

Interface for classes whose instances can be written to and restored from a Parcel. 
Classes implementing the `Parcelable` interface must also have a non-null static field called **CREATOR** of a type that implements the `Parcelable.Creator` interface.

### There are two options to realize serialization:

1. Serializable Interface
2. Parcelable Interface (Android Only)

Here parcelable is more efficient. It could be used to **transfer object by intents** and **IPC** (inter-process communication). In general, we could only use intents to pass values like int, string and so on. But now with Parcelable, you can transfer **Objects** like a car, a person :P

PS: Both of these two interfaces could achieve this. `Bundle.putSerializable(Key, Object)` for `Serializable` interface. `Bundle.putParcelable(Keyï¼ŒObject)` for `Parcelable` interface.

###  How to choose between them?

1. Parcelable is more frequent in the use of memory.

2. Serializable will produce a large number of temporary variables which causes freqiemt GC.

3. Parcelable is not appropriate to place any Parcel data in to persistent storage. Changes in the underlying implementation of any of the data in the Parcel can render older data unreadable. In this situation, Serializable could be better.

> Why serialization? 
> 1) To permanently save the object, by sequence of bytes saved to a local file. 
> 2) To pass an object in the network. 3) To pass an object between processes (IPC). 

### When to use it?

If you need to transfer complex data types (objects) between components like Activity or Service. For simple data like int, just use Intent directly.

public class ObjectA implements Parcelable {
 
	private String strValue;
	private Integer intValue;

	 * Standard basic constructor for non-parcel object creation
	 */
	public ObjectA() {};
 
	/**
	 * Constructor to use when re-constructing object
	 * from a parcel
	 */
	public ObjectA(Parcel in) {
		readFromParcel(in);
	}
 	
 	/**
     * This field is needed for Android to be able to
     * create new objects, individually or as arrays.
     * This also means that you can use the default
     * constructor to create the object and use another
     * method to hyrdate it as necessary. It's easier to 
     * use the constructor.
